Error in rule bwa_map:
    jobid: 5
    input: resources/genome.fa, resources/samples/B.fastq
    output: mapped_reads/B.bam
    shell:
        bwa mem resources/genome.fa resources/samples/B.fastq | samtools view -Sb - > mapped_reads/B.bam
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job bwa_map since they might be corrupted:
mapped_reads/B.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
